I am a detail-oriented Data Analyst seeking to leverage strong analytical and problem-solving skills to data-driven decision-making and improve your life and business outcomes
I am a freelance data analyst specialized in energy big data, with over 10 years of experience turning complex datasets into actionable insights.

My journey began as a researcher in Electrical Power Engineering, where I discovered a passion for data-driven problem solving that shaped my career shift into analytics.

Since then, I have collaborated with global leaders including McKinsey, the European Union, EBRD, JICA, GGFR, Times, and the UNFCCC.

My work spans energy balance analysis, the Egypt Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy, Egyptâ€™s first Biennial Transparency Report to the UNFCCC, and low-carbon strategy development with McKinsey.

I believe that insightful analysis creates powerful outcomes. My mission is to help businesses and institutions unlock the value of data to drive smarter, sustainable decisions.
